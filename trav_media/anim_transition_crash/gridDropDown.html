            <h2>Nature is on View and Wilderness is Truly Wild</h2>
            <p>Established in 1939 to provide a critical stopover for migrating waterfowl, the refuge is well known for the thousands
              of sandhill cranes, geese and other waterfowl that winter here each year.</p>
  
            <p>Situated between the Chupadera Mountains to the west and the San Pascual Mountains to the east, the 57,331-acre
              refuge harbors a wild stretch of the Rio Grande, a ribbon of cottonwood and willow trees visible on the landscape
              from distant mesas.
            </p>
  
            <p>Petroglyphs tell the story of an ancient people that lived and hunted here. The river and its diversity of wildlife
              have drawn humans to this area for at least 11,000 years when humans migrated along this corridor, sometimes
              settling to hunt, fish and farm. Artifacts and stone tools found nearby tell us that nomadic paleoindian hunters
              pursued herds of mammoth and bison in the valley.</p>
  
            <p>Today, Bosque del Apache is part of the National Wildlife Refuge System, a national network of lands and waters
              set aside and managed for the benefit of wildlife, habitat and you.</p>

            <h2>Resource Management</h2>
  
            <p>When thousands of migratory birds arrive at Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge, they find fresh water in
              the impoundment ponds, and acres of habitat and wetlands to gather, feed, and rest.</p>
  
            <p>Refuge staff depends upon and utilizes various tools to manage the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge for
              the benefit of wildlife. Management tools used on the refuge include prescribed burning, exotic plant control,
              moist soil management, farming and water level manipulation.</p>
  
            <p>Bosque del Apache Refuge cooperates with local farmers to grow crops for wintering waterfowl and cranes. Farmers
              plant alfalfa and corn, harvesting the alfalfa and leaving the corn for wildlife. The refuge staff grows corn,
              winter wheat, clover, and native plants as additional food, supplements for migrating waterfowl and other wildlife.</p>
  
            <p>The refuge uses gates and dams to flood and drain certain wetlands on seasonal schedules. Lowering water levels
              in marshes to create moist fields promotes growth of native marsh plants. Marsh management is rotated so that
              varied habitats are always available. Dry impoundments are disced or burned, then re-flooded, to allow natural
              marsh plants to grow. When mature marsh conditions are reached, the cycle is repeated. Wildlife foods grown this
              way include smartweed, millets, chufa, bulrush, and sedges.</p>
  
            <p>Many cottonwood and willow bosques that once lined the Rio Grande have been lost to human developments. Salt cedar
              or "tamarisk," originally introduced as an ornamental plant and for erosion control, has taken over vast areas.
              It is a plant that has very little value to wildlife. Salt cedar is being cleared and areas are being planted
              with cottonwood, black willow, and understory plants to restore native bosques that are used by wildlife to nest,
              rest and feed. </p>
  
            <p>Irrigation canals ensure critical water flow. Daily monitoring, mowing, and clearing keeps them functioning. Controlling
              the water enables refuge staff to manage the habitat. Throughout the refuge, a network of small canals connects
              different “moist soil units” with the region’s main water supply, which is a 57-mile canal that runs along the
              river. Each moist-soil unit can be flooded or drained as needed to grow the best mix of wetland plants to feed
              migrating birds. With wetland plants hearty and thriving, a great diversity of native wildlife -- from prowling
              coyotes to year-round and migratory birds – continue to live in and around the wetlands.</p>
